# Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

**Status**: In Progress

- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Define core architecture
- [ ] Literature review and research synthesis
- [ ] Dataset acquisition and preprocessing
- [ ] Baseline model implementation

**Timeline**: Weeks 1-2

## Phase 2: Baseline Development

**Goals**: Establish baseline performance metrics

- [ ] Implement data loaders for HAM10000, ISIC
- [ ] Train baseline models (ResNet, EfficientNet)
- [ ] Evaluate baseline performance
- [ ] Conduct fairness audit on baseline models
- [ ] Document performance disparities across skin tones

**Timeline**: Weeks 3-4

## Phase 3: Fairness-Aware Modeling

**Goals**: Implement and evaluate fairness techniques

- [ ] Implement balanced sampling strategies
- [ ] Integrate fairness regularization in loss functions
- [ ] Apply adversarial debiasing
- [ ] Explore reweighting and post-processing techniques
- [ ] Comparative evaluation of fairness methods

**Timeline**: Weeks 5-7

## Phase 4: Advanced Architectures

**Goals**: Leverage modern vision transformers

- [ ] Implement ConvNeXt architecture
- [ ] Implement Swin Transformer
- [ ] Implement Vision Transformer (ViT)
- [ ] Compare performance vs. CNN baselines
- [ ] Fine-tune for fairness and accuracy

**Timeline**: Weeks 8-10

## Phase 5: Comprehensive Evaluation

**Goals**: Rigorous testing and validation

- [ ] Subgroup analysis by Fitzpatrick scale
- [ ] Cross-dataset validation (generalization)
- [ ] Clinical case studies
- [ ] Interpretability analysis (attention maps, SHAP)
- [ ] Ablation studies

**Timeline**: Weeks 11-12

## Phase 6: Documentation & Dissemination

**Goals**: Share findings with research community

- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Research paper draft
- [ ] Code documentation and examples
- [ ] Public model release (with ethical guidelines)
- [ ] Conference submission

**Timeline**: Weeks 13-14
